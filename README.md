# Face_Mask_Detection
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has continued to be the source of plight for millions of lives and companies even in 2020, was witnessed at the end of 2019. There is a wave of anxiety among all individuals, especially those who wish to resume in-person activity, as the world recovers from the pandemic and prepares to return to a state of normalcy. Studies have shown that wearing a face mask decreases the risk of viral transmission substantially as well as offers a sense of security. However, monitoring the implementation of this policy manually is not feasible. Here, technology holds the key. An important and economic approach to the use of AI to build a stable approach In a production setup, the setting. A hybrid model using For face mask detection, deep and classical machine learning It will be sent. A dataset of face mask detection consists of With mask and without mask images, we will use To do real-time face detection from a live stream via OpenCV With our webcam. To build a COVID-19 face, we will use the dataset to Computer vision mask detector. Our goal is to decide whether the Wearing a face mask or not is a person on the image/video stream.
